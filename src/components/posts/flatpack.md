## Modular FlatPack (MDP)

*Project*


#### What is my Modular Flatpack?
The Modular Flatpack is a furniture product that transforms from one type of furniture to another. An example in my design being from bed frame to a modular storage system/cupboard to little modules to store shoes or clothes. The idea of flatpacking came to mind when designing due to its ability to be compact and easily transportable, further reducing the amoount of pollution when delivering the product.

#### Process:
This project was made by following the practices and principles of design and development. At the start of the project, I first brainstormed potential problems in the world that could be solved. Looking into a range of fields from software to health. But the one that really caught my eye was that of the furniture industry and how much waste is produced per year from just Furniture alone. As such I decided to take action on the problem. Initially I had started by sketching ideas on furniture that could be re-used or recycled, Then on these sketches I began prototyping using CAD and 3D printers to develop small scaled models. Building upon faults in previous iterations of design, I eventually developed a product that was both compact, reusable, recycleable, affordable and easy to construct.

This project required us to operate in an agile approach, utilising test driven development to quickly but effectively complete the project. We also used Git as a way to contribute to our code base simultaneously branching off the master branch and merging back in. Weekly standups were used as a way to update each group member on any progress or challenges made.

#### Reflection:
Through completion of this project I have experienced working an an agile development cycle, Following TDD, I now understand how majority of projects are made and progress. Reflecting on this project I believe one of the most valuable things that I learnt was practicing Git.

#### Next steps:
Learning from this experience, I want to work more with backend content and API's, Potentially looking into developing a platform to showcase an NBA API.
