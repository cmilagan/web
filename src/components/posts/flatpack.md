## Modular FlatPack (MDP)

*Project*


#### What is my Modular Flatpack?
The Modular Flatpack is a furniture product that transforms from one type of furniture to another. An example in my design being from bed frame to a modular storage system/cupboard to little modules to store shoes or clothes. The idea of flatpacking came to mind when designing due to its ability to be compact and easily transportable, further reducing the amoount of pollution when delivering the product.

#### Process:
This project was made by following the practices and principles of design and development. At the start of the project, I first brainstormed potential problems in the world that could be solved. Looking into a range of fields from software to health. But the one that really caught my eye was that of the furniture industry and how much waste is produced per year from just Furniture alone. As such I decided to take action on the problem. Initially I had started by sketching ideas on furniture that could be re-used or recycled, Then on these sketches I began prototyping using CAD and 3D printers to develop small scaled models. Building upon faults in previous iterations of design, I eventually developed a product that was both compact, reusable, recycleable, affordable and easy to construct.

This project required alot of planning and consistency throughout the one year timeframe to complete. As such I had created a time line to complete certain aspects of the project.

#### Reflection:
Completion of this project has allowed me to appreciate how much effort and consideration goes into designing a product that targets both a problem and is usable by people. Reflecting on the whole process of developing this product has made me proud, comparing the initial sketches to the final design product really shows how much progress can be made in terms of skill in just a year.

#### Next steps:
Following a similar design process, I want to create a software product, something that solves a problem and can be easily used by people.
