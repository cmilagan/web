## Flockr (Python/Flask)

*Project*


#### What is Flockr?
Flockr is a communication platform similar to slack or discord. It provides users with the capability of managing your account with profile pictures, passwords, displayed names and more. Similar to what you would expect on any communication platform. It contains features such as group channels, private channels and public channels, providing flexibility and privacy for the users of Flockr.

#### Process:
The main purpose of this project was to develop a functioning backend with very little modification to the frontend. Initially the project started off by creating a large collection of blackbox tests. These tests were extremely thorough, covering all the edge cases possible. The initial tests made were covering the most basic features of the application, which included registering a user in the backend. Sending and storing messages in the backend as well as adding users to different channels. From these tests, the implementation of code was then made. This process was followed throughout the whole project, from the most simple functionality, to the more complex and tedious features.

This project required us to operate in an agile approach, utilising test driven development to quickly but effectively complete the project. We also used Git as a way to contribute to our code base simultaneously branching off the master branch and merging back in. Weekly standups were used as a way to update each group member on any progress or challenges made.

#### Reflection:
Through completion of this project I have experienced working an an agile development cycle, Following TDD, I now understand how majority of projects are made and progress. Reflecting on this project I believe one of the most valuable things that I learnt was practicing Git.

#### Next steps:
Learning from this experience, I want to work more with backend content and API's, Potentially looking into developing a platform to showcase an NBA API.
