## LoopMania (Java/JFX)

*Project*


#### What is LoopMania?
LoopMania is a videogame developed using Object Oriented Priciples/Design in Java. This videogame starts by the character starting at the beginning of a loop, fighting enemies and gearing up to survive until they win. This videogame includes complex win conditions utilising design patterns such as Decarator, Composite, Observer, State and Strategy. LoopMania was an 8 week project where I got to learn so much about object oriented programming.


<br />

#### Process:
From the beginning of the project, It was important to first design a UML diagram showcasing the relationships between the different classes, This was constructed by refering deeply to documentation and requirements created based off of what was wanted/needed in the game. I had also constructed/planned out a Low Fidelity Front end design in which we would construct our front end interface off of.

It was important to be extremely organised such that the project could be finished within the 8 week timeframe which was allocated, as such we operated in an agile approach, utilising test driven development to quickly but effectively complete the project. The use of Git practices vastly increased the productivity of our group as we had branched out and communicated effectively to make sure that no errors were made.

#### Reflection:
This project has opened my eyes to the possibilities of programming, Through utilisation of design patterns and object oriented principles, I understand how code can be managed and extended upon in development.

#### Next steps:
Learning from this experience, I want to create a game of my own, defining my own specifications and rules of my own.
