## Neural Stimulator (C/Python)

*Project*


#### What is StimPact?
StimPact is a wirelessly controlled Neural Stimulator that is to be used on animals as small as Rats. The purpose of this stimulator is to send electrical pulses to the neurons in the animal, and recording/analysing the responses of stimulation. This project has been worked on by an interdisciplinary team of students consisting of electrical and mechatronics engineers as well as computer science students.


<br />

#### Responsibilities:
Being part of the Software team, I am responsible for creating and developing both the firmware and software side. The firmware side is the brains of the stimulator itself. Communicating with the software to execute any commands sent from the software via BLE. The firmware has multiple channels which allows it to send data back to the user interface on the Software.

#### Reflection:
This is the first project in which I have been exposed to solving real world problems using my skills as a computer science student. Being part of this project has pushed me to learn more about my field and beyond, inspiring me to become a better software developer. This project has had many steep learning curves, some of which I have yet to overcome. Regardless of this, participation in this project has allowed me to learn so much, both as a developer and a member of a team


#### Next steps:
From this experience, I hope to program more with Python, developing applications targeted towards real world problems.
