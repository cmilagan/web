## About this website

*Project*


#### Significance:
This website was created as a platform to showcase who I am as a developer. Highlighting my favourite projects, courses
and experiences as both a student and aspiring software engineer. Countless of hours has gone into making this website, with a basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript I had faced many challenges on the way. This website is my first completed project with JavaScript/REACT, where previously I had faced to many hurdles and decided to restart multiple times. As such I feel as though it will always be a project I am proud of.


<br />

#### Process:
Self-teaching myself HTML/CSS/JavaScript has been both rewarding and challenging. Starting from essentially ground 0, I had many initial doubts as to what I could potentially create in this website. Nevertheless through planning and trial and error, I had reached a design in which I was satisfied with. Incorporating some of my favourite colours of blue and orange as the theme of the website. As well as giving it a neon glow to add more depth and give more life to the website.

#### Next steps:
Learning from making this website has made me want to explore more of front end development, I hope to venture more into product design and more practical uses. Regardless you will see all my future projects here :D
