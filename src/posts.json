Highlighting my favourite projects, courses\r\nand experiences as both a student and aspiring software engineer. Countless of hours has gone into making this website, with a basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript I had faced many challenges on the way. This website is my first completed project with JavaScript/REACT, where previously I had faced to many hurdles and decided to restart multiple times. As such I feel as though it will always be a project I am proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n#### Process:\r\nSelf-teaching myself HTML/CSS/JavaScript has been both rewarding and challenging. Starting from essentially ground 0, I had many initial doubts as to what I could potentially create in this website. Nevertheless through planning and trial and error, I had reached a design in which I was satisfied with. Incorporating some of my favourite colours of blue and orange as the theme of the website. As well as giving it a neon glow to add more depth and give more life to the website.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n*Image of initial design*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmilagan/web/80ec2ea4bd01e4297382471a2bb18c2bcd966bbf/src/images/personalweb.PNG\"\r\n     alt=\"\"\r\n     width=\"500\"\r\n     height=\"300\"\r\n     style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\" />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Next steps:\r\nLearning from making this website has made me want to explore more of front end development, I hope to venture more into product design and more practical uses. Regardless you will see all my future projects here :D\r\n"},{"id":1629468000,"title":"My First Post\r","author":"Christian Ilagan\r","date":"August 21, 2021\r","content":"\r\n## Welcome to my blog!!!\r\n\r\n*First of many blog posts*\r\n\r\nHello World!\r\nThis is the very first blog post I have made for my personal website.
